											<h1>Hi! I'm Jackie.</h1>
											<p>I'm a game developer and this is my portfolio #TODO</p>
										</header>
										<p>#TODO<br>
											This is a WIP.<br>
											I've wanted to make games since I started playing games.<br>
											Been working in tech for a long time but i've decided it's time to focus on my true calling:
											Game Development.<br>
											'GameDev' as a whole interests me, so both Gameplay Design and Programming are things I love doing.
											Here you will find an assortment of my projects over the years.<br>

										<p>
											I developed <i>Robot Anti-Alien Defense Squad</i> solo in under 72hs for the
											<a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-84-bubbles/rate/1121008">Mini Jam #84</a>.
											And ooh boy, did I have a good time at it! It scratched my GameDev itch so bad I felt
											satisfied enough for a year. But I keep coming back to it wanting to do it again,
											and that's the reason I know this is my true career path.

											#TODO Image with link

										</p>

										<p>
											Now that you played the game, let me tell you what I think about it:
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>What I think is right:</b>
											<li>The game's design core is clear: "Challenge the player by tying their ammo to their movement" </li>
										You're no longer able to run and gun like in classic shmups, you're forced to make calculated and very tactical shots.
											<li>Almost every element of the game ties back into the core.</li>
											<li>Extensively fine-tuning the game object's values paid off, so its infinite game loop
											really hooks you in.</li>

										</p>

										<p>
											<b>What I'd do different:</b>
											<li>Better communicate the main mechanics through UX/UI. As it stands some players may be
											thrown off by their sudden lack of movement.</li>
										</p>
										<p>I developed R.A.A.D.S. using <a href="https://ctjs.rocks">ct.js</a>, which does not provide
											any Version Control or VC Integration. As such, I have not uploaded my code to GitHub
											but you may take a look at my code by... {????} .</p>

									</header>
									<div>
										<p>
											<i>This is a project that is very dear to me but is yet to be finished.
											It was initially meant for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/narrative-driven-jam-1">
											Narrative Driven Jam</a>. Due to Covid-19 we stopped working on this game, but after a very eventful year,
											I can happily announce the team has resumed development and will soon see the light of day!</i>
										</p>

										<span class="image object">
											<img src="images/LockedInnCover.png" alt="Locked Inn's Cover" >
										</span>
										<p>
											<i>Locked Inn</i> is a Murder Mystery styled as a Visual Novel, where you play as the
											feline successor to the hotel's elevator operator. As such, you must take the
											guests to their rooms, unavoidably overhearing their conversations.
											Luckily guests don't mind you picking the order in which you drop them off, so
											you get to be smart about which conversations will happen, and in so doing,
											helping you solve the murder of your late owner.
										</p>
										<p>
											Here you can witness the first couple of minutes of playtime:
											#TODO
										</p>
										<p>
											Most of the game plays like that. Every night you overhear a situation, choose who to let go,
											and then listen to the rest unfold.
											After enough nights you should have enough information to deduce who's behind the awful crime and why.
										</p>

										<p>Our amazing team consisted of a gameplay designer, an illustrator, a sound designer and me.
										I handled the game's concept, programming and story, and also the project's coordination.
										All the effort showcased here was achieved under 10 days, so even though we didn't meet the Jam's deadline
										I consider it to be a success. And taking into account all the lessons I learned because of it,
										I can say it was a huge success at that.</p>

<!--										I was having trouble committing to a single personal project, so a colleague
										suggested we join a Game Jam. Working with a rigid timeline seemed like the way
										to go, so we assembled a team and signed up for the NDGJ

										Roles.

										Consigna: timeframe, theme.

										Explicar el juego. Muchos gifs

										Challenges: RESUMIR{
										i should have asked someone else to handle programming

										learned do's and dont's of project management and people coordination, teamwork
										in general was a big leaning point. i also developed better delegation skills.

										working with a time constrain was also a learning moment for me.

										i learned how complex it is to work with an interdisciplinary team and the
										different hardships that come with developing a game with other people.
										differences in working alone and with other people.
										luckily my team was ***super amazing*** and they made this learning moment an ejoyable one.
										} O: {learning on the go, first team project, new role: PM, time constraint}

										Learnings: Entrust & Delegate.

									<p>
										Extreme Ripoff is a fully playable game made for my Algorithms and Data Structures II class.
										It's also an endless source of funtration for anyone playing it (fun AND frustration).
									</p>
									<p>
										The art and gameplay design were provided to us, while we were tasked with
										the technical design and implementation using C++11
										and SDL2 as well as to abide by <i>very strict</i> algorithmic optimization guidelines.
										<br>
										We were a team of 3 and it took us a month to complete with about 15 hours of focused work every week.
									</p>
									<p>
										<!-- #TODO LONG GAMEPLAY GIF/VIDEO -->
										Here you control a holy fire-spewing exorcist, and every time she kills a specific
										ghost, she gets to relive her previous experience but with one more ghost in the room, which
										copies your last movements in a loop.
										<br>
										<!-- #TODO 'NEXT LEVEL' MECHANIC GIF/VIDEO-->
										That's how you end up in a situation like this:
										<!-- #TODO MANYGHOSTS.JPG-->
										<br>
										The main mechanic was shamelessly ripped off from a small indie game called
										<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/334100/Extreme_Exorcism/">Extreme Exorcism</a>.
										<br>
										As I mentioned above, our data modeling and algorithms were held to comply with
										strict time and memory complexities, so the game would be playable on enormous maps
										with many thousands of ghosts (even running on low-end hardware). This was a challenge, but
										it was one of the most awesome learning experiences I've had in academia.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Playing the game:</b>
										Portability for C++ projects is a bit of a mess,
										but I'm working on a WebAssembly build so it can be deployed here.
										On the meantime, you're welcome to look at our code and compile it from source.
